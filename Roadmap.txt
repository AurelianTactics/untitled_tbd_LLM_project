Coding parts to prototype

DONE langchain: document which parts I will likely need and want to prototype
	prompt template
	output parser
	function usage
	RAG
		hooked up to chain
		chunks properly
	storage
	memory
		conversation buffer
		entity memory
	chains
		basic pipeline
	evaluation
	embeddings/vector store/chunking
	tools
	debug methods (like debug chains)
	agents
	monitoring

--- working	

langchain through docs with up-to-date examples

get more langchain examples working
	completed: basic usage, prompt template, conversation simple memory, retrieval

plan how going to transition from working examples to simple app
	Need to think out how the architect is done
		the entrypoint, the outputs, how and what I'm going to be wrapping

	DONE need a prompt template
		
	need a simple rag example
		maybe copy or reference a wikipedia page for working example
			https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women#Characters
		maybe a few related pages
		index process
			copy file
			split
			store
				vector store and embeddings
	then build the scaffolding around it?
		need a temporary, simple UI
			need to research th is
		need logging
		monitoring
		evaluation
	then can plan next steps

--- questions
for doing a doc split and save, where am I saving the intermediate results for permanence?


--- to do
misc other
	monitoring
		not sure if through langchain
	Base prompt and specific prompts, proper tone
	have aprocess for prompt improving
	safety
	Summarizes
		text
		voice

familiarize yourself with update to OpenAI API

need a base RAG for entities
	then files for expanding entity info
	then method for summarizing so LLM isn't pulling in a huge history

process for improving prompts

--- Later
can use voice inputs

--- Misc
vscode better integration of copilot


--- Research
feasibility of all parts
think through architecture of idea

DONE Basic log to wandb
DONE Basic OpenAPI example with new api
DONE LangChain basic example
