Coding parts to prototype

DONE langchain: document which parts I will likely need and want to prototype
	prompt template
	output parser
	function usage
	RAG
		hooked up to chain
		chunks properly
	storage
	memory
		conversation buffer
		entity memory
	chains
		basic pipeline
	evaluation
	embeddings/vector store/chunking
	tools
	debug methods (like debug chains)
	agents
	monitoring

--- working	

chain working example
	DONE stupid notebook for now until able to flesh it out a bit
	DONE TEST uses theprompt template
	DONE TEST uses the embeddingt template
	DONE makes the basic chain
	uses some memory
		MEH BAD EXAMPLE use the last RAG example
			https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/cookbook/retrieval
		got some memory working but kind of clunky. see if there is a better way to do it
		stub out in questions all the differetn ways and best way to do it
		
	
when basic examples think through next steps to something more full fleshed
	logging, monitoring, evaluation
	prompt improvement template


plan how going to transition from working examples to simple app
	DONE Need to think out how the architect is done
		the entrypoint, the outputs, how and what I'm going to be wrapping

	DONE need a prompt template

	DONE data load / embedding utils template
		DONE longer term / wishlist of features
		
	DONE BASICALLY PUT RETRIEVER IN PIPELINE need a simple rag example
		maybe copy or reference a wikipedia page for working example
			https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women#Characters
		maybe a few related pages
		index process
			copy file
			split
			store
				vector store and embeddings
	then build the scaffolding around it?
		need a temporary, simple UI
			need to research th is
		need logging
		monitoring
		evaluation
		LangSmith for evaluation what is going on inside the application
	then can plan next steps





--- questions
for doing a doc split and save, where am I saving the intermediate results for permanence?

https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/quickstart
	understand the retriever and format docs part better

for memory better to embed in prompt or in a conversation chain?


--- to do

periodically can do:
	langchain through docs with up-to-date examples

	get more langchain examples working
	completed: basic usage, prompt template, conversation simple memory, retrieval

misc other
	UI
	monitoring
		not sure if through langchain
	Base prompt and specific prompts, proper tone
	have aprocess for prompt improving
	safety
	Summarizes
		text
		voice

familiarize yourself with update to OpenAI API

need a base RAG for entities
	then files for expanding entity info
	then method for summarizing so LLM isn't pulling in a huge history

process for improving prompts

--- Later
can use voice inputs

--- Misc
vscode better integration of copilot


--- Research
feasibility of all parts
think through architecture of idea


--- Scrap
DONE Basic log to wandb
DONE Basic OpenAPI example with new api
DONE LangChain basic example

DONE test out the chain
	TEST integrates with prompt template
	TEST integrates with embedding utils template
